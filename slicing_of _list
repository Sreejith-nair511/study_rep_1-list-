#slicing is a method of retrieving multiple values from the list[]
#its syntax includes listname with semicolon
#example as follows
cars=['lambo','ferrai','buggati','mustang']
print(cars[0:4])
#the entire list is printed ,first value is thr intail point,second value end ,which will be n-1
#another example
print(cars[0:3])#printed from 0 to 2
#if we just use :then we get the enitre list
print(cars[:])#enitre list given 
#we  can also use just one value to get value 
print(cars[:3])
print(cars[1:])
#ro find the length of list ,we use len()
print(len(cars))#output is 4
